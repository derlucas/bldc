BLDC - Electronic Speed Controller Firmware
=====================

This is the source code for the Electronic Speed Controllers(ESC) like
VESC&copy;, FOCBOX, ESK1.1, OLLIN ESC1.1 and probably others.

This fork is based on Benjamin Vedders bldc Firmware. So mostly his work and
kudos to him.


This fork is due to trademark stuff i don't like, so i add my wanted features
here. Please see my esc_tool repository for a compatible ESC tool to configure
your ESC.
